## Summary:

In this exploration, the Leave-One-Out cross-validation model is used to compare two cognitive models: the Prototype model by [Rosch](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2003-02712-010) and the Exemplar model by [Nosofsky](https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/0096-3445.117.4.412). Given a feature vector for a random animal, both try to predict whether the animal is a bird or a fish. A multi-dimensional scaling plot is also used to visualize these animals.

Data is sourced from [De Deyne et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/BRM.40.4.1030).
