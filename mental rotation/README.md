## Summary:

In this exploration, Linear Regression are used to find the relationship between the reaction time of subjects and their ability to mentally rotate a 3-d object. The results are compared within-subjects as well as across-subjects and are presented using many subplots! This is based on work by [Shepard & Metzler](https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1126/science.171.3972.701).
