## Summary:

In this exploration, I use Pandas + numpy to calculate the means and standard deviations of participant data. 
Using this, I estimate the Weber fraction, which is a measure of statistical uncertainty.
This is based on the work by [Pica et al.](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1102085) who found similar uncertainties of numerical estimations among various indigenous groups.
