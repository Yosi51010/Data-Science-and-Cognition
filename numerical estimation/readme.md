## Summary:

In this exploration, Pandas + Numpy are used to calculate the Mean, Standard Deviation and Mean-Squared-Error of participant's numerical estimations. This aligns with the work done by [Miller](https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/h0043158) for the "magical number 7" as an attention capacity.

Along the way, an estimate for the Weber fraction (a measure of statistical uncertainty) is also generated.
This is similar to the work by [Pica et al.](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1102085) who found similar patterns in the uncertainties of numerical estimations among various indigenous groups.
