## Summary:

In this exploration, Euclidean distance, Cosine Similarity and Pearson Correlation are used to generate a cognitive model that implements Prototype Theory, as coined by [Rosch](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2003-02712-010). Given a feature vector for a random bird, it will predict how "bird-like" it is by outputting a "goodness" rating!
